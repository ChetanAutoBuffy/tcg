# The Chadha Group: Four Generations Building Brands That Work

**POTOMAC, MD – November 4, 2025** – The Chadha Group (TCG) is a fourth-generation family business that's been perfecting automotive products for over 100 years. Today, we're sharing what makes us different: we don't just sell parts — we build the technology that makes sure every customer gets exactly what they need, when they need it.

## Not a Company. A Family.

Since the 1920s, the Chadha family has been obsessed with one thing: delivering products you can actually count on.

**Santokh Chadha** (1920s-1950s) laid the foundation — precision, integrity, and relentless attention to quality.

**Kuldip Chadha** (1950s-1990s) scaled manufacturing through Sigma and Beta Industries, building partnerships with global OEMs while maintaining uncompromising standards.

**Hardeep Chadha** (1970s-Present) launched Westar in 1986, establishing it as the industry standard for engine mounts and suspension components. 3,200+ SKUs. ISO-certified. Trusted worldwide.

**Chetan Chadha** (2011-Present) brought AI and automation to the family business — building the technology that now powers Westar, Premium Shocks, RC Automotive, and Auto Buffy.

Each generation pushed boundaries. Each generation built systems. Each generation set new standards.
