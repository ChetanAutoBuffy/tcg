### **The Program**

**Engine Mount Kits (1,175 Kits)**  
Complete engine and transmission mount assemblies that bundle all necessary mounts under a single part number. Each kit includes every mount required for a full replacement job—ensuring compatibility and eliminating the need to source individual components.

**Air Suspension Kits (336 Kits)**  
Vehicle-specific kits that include all components needed for a complete four-corner suspension rebuild. Designed for professional installers and DIY enthusiasts who want a complete solution without piecing together individual parts.

### **Why Kits Matter**

**Hardeep Chadha, Chairman, The Chadha Group:**

> "There's no such thing as one motor mount going bad. When one mount fails, the others are already compromised—they're load-bearing components working as a system. Replace one, and you're just delaying the inevitable. The other mounts have been absorbing extra stress, wearing unevenly, and they'll fail soon after. It's not about upselling—it's about doing the job right the first time."

**Chetan Chadha, CEO, The Chadha Group:**

> "By ensuring we carry all the components needed for a complete repair, we help our customers finish the job without delays or guesswork. Our kits are built around how parts actually work together—not just how they're sold individually. This saves time for anyone repairing or installing these systems, whether it's a professional shop or someone working in their driveway."
