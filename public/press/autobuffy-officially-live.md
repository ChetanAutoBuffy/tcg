## **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**
**January 12, 2026**

**Savage, MD** — Today is a big day for us at AutoBuffy.

After a long build, **AutoBuffy.com** is officially live on a new platform that finally gives us the foundation we've been waiting for. This isn't about a redesign. It's about building something that can scale, adapt, and actually help people fix their vehicles the right way.

### **Multi-Brand, Quality-First**

AutoBuffy has never been about pushing one house brand. Yes, we carry Westar, but we also carry the brands people already trust and ask for—**FCS, KYB, Monroe, MOOG, Detroit Axle, TrakMotive, Bosch, Dorman**, and many more. We'll continue adding lines as we grow.

**Chetan Chadha, CEO of AutoBuffy and Partner at The Chadha Group (TCG):**

> "I'm a big believer in brands. These companies have spent decades and millions of dollars engineering, testing, and supporting their products. We respect that. If you're a quality brand and you stand behind your parts, you have a home on AutoBuffy."

### **Kits on Demand**

The core of AutoBuffy has always been kits. Most people don't want to guess their way through a repair or order parts one by one. They want everything they need, together, and they want to know it's right.

With this new platform, we're excited to launch **kits on demand**—built specifically for each vehicle and repair.

### **Platform Features**

Some of the features we're most excited about:

- **On-the-go installation guidance** that helps customers understand what they're doing
- **Smarter fitment intelligence** that starts with manufacturer data like ACES and PIES, then goes further by using AI to explain compatibility in plain English
- **A buying experience** that reduces confusion instead of adding to it

**Chetan Chadha:**

> "A lot of customers don't actually know what they need—and that's not their fault. Our job is to take complicated data, real-world experience, and industry knowledge, and turn it into something that helps people get back on the road without wasting money or time."

### **The TCG Foundation**

From the TCG side, this launch reflects how we build businesses.

**Hardeep Chadha, Chairman of TCG:**

> "Under The Chadha Group's guidance, we feel we have the right people in place. From our manufacturing partners and reps, to the internal team, to Chetan leading both the technology and the vision as CEO—we believe this platform is a winner. This is what TCG is about: quality parts supported by quality systems."

### **Quality Over Price**

AutoBuffy isn't trying to be the cheapest option online. We're here to sell parts that fit, parts that last, and brands that stand behind their products.

**This launch is just the beginning.**
