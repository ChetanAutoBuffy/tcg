# The Chadha Group Announces Official Launch

**POTOMAC, MD – November 4, 2025** – The Chadha Group (TCG), a century-old family enterprise built on four generations of automotive excellence, today announced its official evolution into a technology-driven powerhouse that is fundamentally reshaping how automotive commerce operates globally.

## The Evolution: From Legacy to Innovation Leadership

What sets The Chadha Group apart is not just longevity, but the rare combination of deep industry knowledge with relentless technological innovation. While many century-old companies struggle to adapt, TCG has deliberately engineered its transformation into a vertically integrated technology ecosystem that spans:

**Manufacturing Excellence:** Westar (established 1986) – Industry-leading OE-quality engine mounts and transmission components serving global markets with ISO-certified precision

**Strategic Distribution:** Sophisticated wholesale networks spanning North America, with established relationships across OEM and aftermarket channels

**Direct-to-Consumer Innovation:** Premium Shocks, RC Automotive, and Auto Buffy – brands that combine traditional quality with modern e-commerce sophistication

**Proprietary Technology Stack:** Six AI-powered platforms that have generated over $10M in revenue while processing millions of automotive transactions

## Technology Leadership: Building the Infrastructure for What's Next

TCG's technology division has quietly developed what many consider the most comprehensive automotive commerce platform in the industry:

**Buffy360** – Enterprise SaaS platform managing real-time inventory synchronization, dynamic pricing algorithms, vendor feed automation, and omnichannel marketplace integration. This isn't just software; it's the operational backbone powering millions in transactions.

**ab7** – Marketing orchestration platform that transforms raw product data into optimized campaigns across Google Ads, Amazon, eBay, and emerging channels. Think of it as the intelligence layer that ensures every product reaches its ideal customer.

**ImageIQ** – Computer vision pipeline that processes thousands of product images daily, handling everything from background normalization to kit composition. What used to take hours now happens in minutes.

**PartsIQ** – The data transformation engine that converts complex ACES/PIES catalogs into intelligent, searchable, and commerce-ready datasets. This solves one of the automotive industry's most persistent challenges.

**Ride360** (launching Q2 2026) – The culmination of everything we've learned: an AI commerce platform that combines predictive fitment, intelligent recommendations, and conversational shopping into a seamless experience that will set the new standard for automotive retail.
