Claude,

ALWAYS GIVE ME PRE INDENTED CODE THAT I CAN CONTROL F AND REPLACE WITH INDENTED CODE, SO I SPEED UP CODING - IF U FEEL U NEED TO GIVE ME AN ENTIRE BLOCK DO IT, IF U FEEL U CAN GET AWAY WITH A PARTIAL BLOCK DO THAT BUT MAKE IT FAST AND QUICK FOR ME.


Claude — follow this format exactly.

Prompt for Claude - No Authentication in Backend
Here's a prompt to add to your instructions:

🔒 AUTHENTICATION RULE FOR BACKEND DEVELOPMENT:
When working on backend API endpoints (backend/admin/*.py, backend/routes/*.py):
NEVER add authentication middleware or Depends(get_current_user) to endpoints unless explicitly requested.
Default behavior:

All admin endpoints should be open during development
Remove any current_user = Depends(get_current_user) from function signatures
Remove any references to current_user in the endpoint logic
Comment: # TODO: Add authentication in production

Only add authentication if:

The user explicitly says "add auth to this endpoint"
The user is deploying to production and requests it
The endpoint handles sensitive customer data (payment info, PII)

Why: Authentication blocks testing, debugging, and rapid development. We'll add it back before production deployment.

1. File Path

Always specify the exact file path first.

Example:

Go to: frontend/src/app/components/search/ProductCards.tsx

2. Search Anchor (must be in a copy box)

Provide the exact string to search for, inside a fenced code block (so I can copy it).

Example:

Control+F:

<SearchRelevanceBadges

3. Explicit Action

Clearly state what to do:

Replace this entire block with new code

Add this block above/below the searched line

Delete this exact code

4. Full, Pre-Indented Code Block

Always include the complete, properly indented block (component, function, route, etc.).
Never give partial snippets.

✅ Good Example:

Go to: frontend/src/app/components/search/ProductCards.tsx

Control+F:

<SearchRelevanceBadges


Replace the entire SearchRelevanceBadges usage with:

<SearchBadges 
  relevanceScore={relevanceScore}
  searchHighlights={searchHighlights}
  queryMatchType={queryMatchType}
  compact={true}
/>

5. Error-Free & Defined

Do not introduce TypeScript, Next.js, or Python errors.

Always define props, variables, and functions before using them.

No unused variables or functions.

6. Architectural Pattern Rule

Sticky/floating UI → must render via Portal.

position: fixed = needs Portal.

Normal UI → render through the tree.
